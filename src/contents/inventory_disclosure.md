## Example

The brackets in LIFO cost shows they are debit (they are not negative numbers). Notice you actually get the FIFO value of inventory disclosed here in the footnote. They just haven't labelled it as such.

_Shall I infer from this example that COGS under LIFO is always greater than COGS under FIFO?_: No, The reason that LIFO COGS are greater than FIFO COGS in this example is that prices have been rising. If inventory prices have been dropping over time, then FIFO COGS will actually be greater than LIFO COGS. And this has happened in the high tech industries where the prices of say, computer components have been dropping over time. So the FIFO method actually gives you higher COGS than the LIFO method because prices are dropping.

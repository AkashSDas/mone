## What is an asset?

Assets are probable future economic benefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity as a result of past transactions or events. `Future economic benefits` means the value that is brought by the asset directly or indirectly to your company.

## Future Economic Benefits

Valuing assets by their future economic benefits means we can't simply hold them in the books the values that they originally cost us.

Consider a phone that you plan on using, will that same phone carry the same future economic benefit for let's say next 5years? may be not, maybe an asteroid fell on it and it will be worth nothing, so its hard to measure the life of a phone or for that matter any product.

Since its hard to calculate the life span of a product and then estimate its future economic benefit instead we use the term `useful economic life` i.e. how long an asset will remain useful to you which is not the same as asset's actual life. It's an estimate. For this we use the term `depreciation`.

Let's go back to the phone example and let's say we bought it for $100, we will depreciate its value by $20/year using the `straight line depreciation` and at the end of the 5th year the phone will be of cost $0.

There is no science in it but esitmates like this help accounts to simplfy the secnario and value assets.

## Substance Over Form

The part `obtained or controlled by a particular entity` in the assets definition highlights one of the important concepts in accounting `substance over form`, this means when preparing financial statements we priotize the **economic substance** of transaction over their legal form.

For example consider a business rents a building for long period of time let's say 60 years and that buildings remaining useful economic benefit is 65 years, although doesn't owns the building technically but in some sense it owns the building because they have the right to use it for majority of its remaining useful economic benefit.

Following the principle of substance over form we can account for this building as an asset even though legally it isn't, this does have big implications for the accounting and tax treatment of the building.This is an over-simiplification of the situation and there are other few factors consider when making this call.

## Types of Assets

The balance sheet is a snapshot of business's assets, liabilites and equity at a point in time. `Assets = Liabilities + Equity`

In the asset section of the balance sheet equation we list all of the assets that company owns/controlls in a decreasing order of their `liquidity` (how quickly you can turn asset into cash). Following the vein of thought the assets can be divided into `Current Assets` and `Non-current Assets`.

### Current Assets

These are assets that can be converted to cash in short time (typically a year). Example of current assets in decreasing order of their liquidity are listed below:

- Cash
- Account receivable
- Inventory
- Prepayments
- Short term investmen

### Non-current Assets

These assets are long term assets that are used in operations to generate profits and can't easily be converted into cash. Example of current assets in decreasing order of their liquidity are listed below:

- Long-term investment
- Tangible assets(PPE, etc...)
- Non-tangible assets(intellectual property)
- Goodwill (other than intellectual property

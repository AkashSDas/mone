## Return on Equity

So is a net income of $10,000,000 good or bad? ... Answer is, it depends in level of investment required, here ROE will helps us to ask better questions.

`Return of Equity (ROE) = Net Income / Shareholder's Equity`

The numerator represents how much return the company generated for shareholders during the year based on accural accounting. The denominator represents the shareholder's investment in the company. Here `you must take the average of beginning and ending balances`.

ROE helps us to measure the `Return on Investemnt (ROI)`. This should increase with the risk of the company.

### Drivers of ROE

The two dirvers of ROE are `Operating performance` and `Financial leverage`.

Operating performance tells how effectively do managers use company resources (assets) to generate profits? which in turn gives use `Return on Assets (ROA)`.

```
ROA = Net Income / Average Assets
```

`Financial leverage` tells how much do the managers use debt to increase avaiable assets for a given level of shareholder investment.

```
Financial leverage = Average Assets / Average Shareholder's Equity
```

Note that `this is different from many leverage ratios` you hear about eg. debt-to-equity

### ROE Framework

Example: Company raises $100 from shareholders and borrows $100 from bank to buy $200 of assets, which are used to generate $10 of net income

ROE = 10% (10/100) <br />
ROA = 5% (10/200) <br />
Leverage = 2 (200/100) <br />

ROE = ROA x Leverage <br />
10% = 5% x 2

## Return On Assets

`Profitability` and `Efficiency` are the two drivers of Return on Assets.

Prfitability is how much profit does the company earn on each dollor of sales? where `Return on Sales (ROS)` is used.

```
ROS = Net Income / Sales
```

Efficiency is how much sales does the company generate based on its avaiable resources? where the `Asset Turnover` is useful.

```
ATO = Sales / Average Assets
```

## ROA and Leverage

Ideally ROA would measure operating performance independent of the company's financing decisions, but the numerator of ROA, Net Income includes Interest Expense.

`More leverage ðŸ‘‰ Higher interet expense ðŸ‘‰ Lower net income`

To truly remove all financing effects from ROA, we must de-lever Net Income

```
ROA = De-Levered Net Income / Average Assets
De-Levered Net Income = Net Income + (1 - t) x Interest Expense
```

Example

![](/return_on_equity_and_assets/img2.png)

```
ROE = (Net Income / Sales) x (Sales / Assets) x (Assets / Equity)
```

```
ROE = Profitability x Efficiency x Leverage
```

## What are adjusting entries?

Adjusting journal entries are used to record transactions that have occurred but have not yet been appropriately recorded in accordance with the accrual method of accounting. This ususally happens at the end of an accounting period

Adjusting journal entries can also refer to financial reporting that corrects a mistake made previously in the accounting period

Adjusting journal entries are recorded in a company's general ledger

An adjusting journal entry involves an income statement account (revenue or expense) along with a balance sheet account (asset or liability).

The most common types of adjusting journal entries are accruals, deferrals, and estimates. So let's discuss about deferred and accured revenues and expenses

## Deferred revenues and expenses

You have to ask the right question in order to recognize deferred expenses or revenues

### Deferred expenses

Question: Are there any assets that have been `used up` this period and should be expensed?

- Examples:
  - Prepaid Rent
  - Prepaid Insurance
  - Depreciation or Amortization

```
Journal Entry:
Debit Expense
    Credit Prepaid Asset
```

### Deferred Revenues

Question: Are there any liabilities that have been fulfilled by delivery of goods/services that should be recognized as revenue?

- Example
  - Unearned rental revenue
  - Deferred subscription revenue

```
Journal Entry:
Debit Unearned Revenue Liability
    Credit Revenue
```

## Accured Revenues and Expenses

### Accured Expenses

Question: Have any expenses accumulated during the period that have not yet been recorded?

- Example
  - Income taxes payable
  - Interest payable
  - Salaires and wages payable

```
Journal Entry:
Debit Expense
    Credit Payable Liability
```

### Accured Revenues

Question: Have any revenues accumulated during the period that have not yet been recorded?

- Example
  - Interest Receivable
  - Rent Receivable

```
Journal Entry:
Debit Receivable Asset
    Credit Revenue
```

## Depreciation and Amortization

Allocate the original cost of a long lived asset over its useful life and it is the total cost of asset to the revenues it generates over its period of use

- Terminology
  - Tangible assets (physical assets) require depreciation
  - Intangible assets (abstract assets) require amortization

### Amount Procedure

Depreciation is not deducted from the tangible asset account, rather its recorded in a `Contra Asset Account (XA)` called `Accumulated Depreciation` which has credit balance and is subtracted from PP&E on the balance sheet to get the `net book value`

Amortization is often (but not always) deducted directly from the intangible asset account

### Straight-line Depreciation

```
Depreciation Expense = (Original Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life
```

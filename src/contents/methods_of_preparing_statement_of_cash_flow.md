## Indirect Method Preparation

`Process`

- Start with Net Income
- Adjust the components of net income tied to non cash items or to investing activities
  - Add back expenses or subtract revenues
  - Non cash items: Depreciation, Amortization
  - Investing activities: Gains/Losses on sales of PP&E or investments
- Adjust the components of net income tied to assets or liablities created through operating activities (i.e. working capital)
  - Add/Subtract changes in asset/liablity account balance
  - Use the balance sheet equation to determine whether to add or subtract
    - **Cash + Non Cash Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

There are 3 main financial statements **balance sheet**, **income statement** and **cash flow statement**.

A **balance sheet** shows what a company `owns` and what it `owes` at a fixed point in time.

The stuff the business owns are `Assets` and the stuff the business owes are broken into 2 components namely `Liabilities` (from third parties) and `Equity`.

The `accounting equation` also called the balance sheet equation is `Assets = Liabilities + Equity`

By using the accounting equation we can also say that `the balance sheet is a snapshot of a business's assets, liabilities and equity at a point in time`.

Also balance sheet equation is the foundation for the double-entry bookkeeping system since for each transaction `the total debits equal the total credits`.

## Link between balance sheet and income statement

When you keep on expanding the equity term in the accounting equation you will see that the 2 of the business's major financial statements i.e. the `income statement` and the `balance sheet` are linked together by `equity`.

## Example

Buying a house is a good example for the use of balance sheet equation. Below the accounting equation balances as `$100 (asset) = $60 (liability) + $40 (equity)`

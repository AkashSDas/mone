## What is an equtiy?

Equity is the residual value of an entity's assets after deducting all it's liabilities, i.e. `Equity = Assets - Liabilities`. So equity is the `net asset`.

The above defination is correct but it doesn't explains what equity is actually. So another definition of equity is given below which explain equity in a much meaningful manner.

Equity represents the net funds invested into a business by its owners.

It is also called `net worth`, `net assets` and `net book value`.

## Sources of shareholder's equity

## Contributed captial (aries from sale of shares)

- Common stock (par value)
- Additional paid-in-capital (excess over par value)
- Treasury stock (stock repurchased by company)

## Retained earnings (aries from operations)

- Accumulation of `net income (= Revenues - Expenses)`, less dividends, since start of business.
- `Retained Earnings (at end) = Retained Earnings (at beginning) + Net Income - Dividends`

## Dividends

Dividends are distributions of retained earnings to shareholders.

- They are not consider as an expense to the company
- Recorded as a reduction of retained earnings on the declaration date (creates a liability until payment date)

## Understanding equity

Equity is a tricky one not because of its concepts but the different words used to describe the same thing.

## Link between balance sheet and income statement

When you keep on expanding the equity term in the accounting equation you will see that the 2 of the business's major financial statements i.e. the `income statement` and the `balance sheet` are linked together by `equity`.

## The statement of cash flow(SCF) has some complications

- Why does the change in balance sheet numbers often not equal the number on the SCF?
- Noncash investing and financing activities
  - Supplemental disclosure below SCF
- Acquisitions and Divertitures of businesses
  - Investing activity that affects balances in operating asset and liability accounts
- Foreign Currency Transaltion Adjustments
  - Changes in cash due to exchange rate movements shown separately
- Subsidiaries in different industries (eg. real estate)
  - Some transactions (eg. buying land) are investing activities in one part of business and operating in another

Also there are disagreements over FASB classification

## Disagreement over FASB classification

- Many investors and analyst prefer to classify
  - Interest payments as a financing activity
    - Cash paid for interest must be disclosed
  - Interest and dividends received as an investing activity
- All income tax effects are shown in the operating section, even if the income relates to financing or investing activities
  - Cash must be diclosed

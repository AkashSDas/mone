The `face value` of the share is split and to keep the money invested in the company constant, the number of share has to be increased. People who have bought stocks before the stock split their number of stocks will increase after the stock split.

Example. Original FV ($2) and Revised FV($1), original number of shares 50,000, revised number of shares 1,00,000, Original value $1,00,000 and Revised value $1,00,000

`Reason` to split stocks is that, if the stock price of a company is high then the many investors won't buy those shares and to avoid that stock split is done.

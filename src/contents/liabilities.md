## What is an liability?

Liabilities are probable future sacrifices of economic benefits arising from present obligations of a particular entity to transfer assets or provide services to other entities in the future as a result of past transactions or events. ðŸ˜µ

`Future sacrifies of economic benefits` are needed to be estimated from `present obligation` (eq. loan) to transfer assets/service (eq. interest/captial payment on/for that loan) to other entities (eq. bank) in the future as a result of past transactions/event (eq. loan given by the bank).

Using `balance sheet equation` (Assets = Liabilities + Equity), a business has two core sources while buying an asset those are **liabilies** or **equity**.

## Types of Liabilites

```
The balance sheet is a snapshot of business's assets, liabilites and equity at a point in time.

Assets = Liabilities + Equity
```

In the liability section of the balance sheet equation we list all of the liabilites that company owes in a decreasing order of their `due dates`.

Following the vein of thought the liabilites can be divided into `Current Liabilities` and `Non-current Liabilities`.

### Current liabilities

Business obligations that are needed to settled down within a year from now are called current liabilities.

- Account payable
- Salaries payable
- Tax payable
- Interest payable
- Accurals
- Unearned revenue (opposite of prepayment)
  - since this is double entry bookkeeping therefore it is an liability
- Short term loans
  - loans that have to be paid within a year
  - portions of long term loans

### Non current liabilities

Business obligations that aren't excepted to be settled within a year from now are called non-current liabilities.

- Long term loans
- Bonds
- Mortages
- Employee pensions
- Deferred income tax

### Contingent liabilities

These are less common than the other two but are worth being aware of them.

Example of this is - assume that a company is facing a lawsuit from a rival firm for patent infringement. The company's legal department thinks that the rival firm has a strong case, and the business estimates a $2 million loss if the firm loses the case. Because the liability is both probable and easy to estimate, the firm posts an accounting entry on the balance sheet to debit (increase) legal expenses for $2 million and to credit (increase) accrued expense for $2 million.

Below figure will tell you what to do in certian situation.

## What is Accural Accounting?

The word accural means `the accumulation or increase of something over time, especially payments or benefits`

Where as the term accural method of accounting, accural accounting as we say is the method in which the recognition of revenues/expenses are tied to business activities and not to cash flows

Revenues are recognized when the goods/services are sold and not when the cash is received. `revenues is not equal cash inflows`

Expenses are recognized in the same period as revenues they helped to generate (Matching Principle). `expenses is not equal cash outflows`

**Matching principle** is the accounting principle that requires that the expenses incurred during a period be recorded in the same period in which the related revenues are earned. This principle recognizes that businesses must incur expenses to earn revenues.

`**Net income is not equal net cash flow**`
